🎮 Mobile vs. Desktop Games

While Divyang is designed to be mobile-friendly, some games require a keyboard and a larger screen for the best experience. We recommend using a desktop for optimal gameplay in certain activities that involve complex interactions or multitasking.

🔹 Mobile-Friendly Games - Simple touch-based interactions, memory games, and focus-based exercises.
🔹 Desktop-Only Games - Advanced problem-solving, multi-step challenges, and games requiring detailed control.
