## 🏆 Problem Statement & Approach

Many neurodiverse individuals, including those with ADHD, Dyslexia, Alzheimer’s, and Autism, struggle with focus, cognitive skills, and confidence-building. While numerous gaming platforms exist, they often come with overwhelming animations, complex interactions, and unnecessary distractions.

---

 ## 🛠 Why Simplicity Matters?

Divyang is designed to be simple and easy to use—avoiding excessive animations or highly reactive elements or any advertisements. Many neurodivergent individuals find fast transitions, flashing effects, or too many interactions overwhelming. To ensure a stress-free and confidence-building experience, the platform focuses on:

✅ Minimalist design – Clean UI with easy navigation.
✅ Low sensory load – No distracting animations, only essential transitions.
✅ Progressive learning – Encouraging users at their own pace without pressure.

## 🎮 Mobile vs. Desktop Games

While Divyang is designed to be mobile-friendly, some games require a keyboard and a larger screen for the best experience. We recommend using a desktop for optimal gameplay in certain activities that involve complex interactions or multitasking.

🔹 Mobile-Friendly Games - Simple touch-based interactions, memory games, and focus-based exercises.

🔹 Desktop-Only Games - Advanced problem-solving, multi-step challenges, and games requiring detailed control.
